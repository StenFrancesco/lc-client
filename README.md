## Overview

In World of Warcraft Classic, there is no in-game loot system catered to automatically handing out certain gear/items that drop from bosses in raids/dungeons. In order to tackle this issue, guilds or premade groups use different systems:

- Rolling: every person who wants it rolls a random 1-100, highest wins
- DKP, Dragon Kill Points: People get to bid with the attendance points accumulated over multiple events
- Loot Council: A fixed group of leadership assigns the dropped item to a specific person. This is decided using several parameters:
  -- person wants the item and has already stated this to leadership
  -- person can have the item and use it for their current talent specialization
  -- person has not received any item for x amount of time

The Lootcouncil app will help the leadership of a guild or an organized pick up group (PUG) handing out items, in order for this to go faster during an event, and for clarity amongst the people attending.
